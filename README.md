Success Kid (SKIDDO) is the first project of such that creates an ecosystem 
underpinned by sustainable yield and liquidity generation protocol to generate 
sustainable charity donations to underprivileged kids around the world.
Sustainable yield and liquidity generation protocol works by applying 10% fee for 
each transaction and instantly splitting that fee by rewarding holders with 5%, auto 
locking 5% in Pancake LP and 10% of total supply in charity reserve wallet. Contract 
allows to exclude certain addresses like PancakeSwap contract address from 
receiving rewards, as well as allows to include certain address to receive reward if 
required.
Sustainability in both yield and liquidity generation – With the explosion of Defi 
many new cryptocurrencies with strong project fundamentals and ideologies have 
their value diminished over time by high APY LP-Farming Trap, they are forced to 
be pushed out by buyers with higher staking rewards leading to inevitable valuation 
bubble, which is then followed by the pump and then the impending collapse of 
the token price. Success Kid (SKIDDO) aim to eradicate the toxicity caused by 
farming rewards by introducing three key features: Static Rewards, Manual Burn 
and Automatic Liquidity Provision. Together these key features aim to create a 
sustainable rewarding ecosystem for holders of (SKIDDO) and ultimately translating 
to sustainable charity donations to underprivileged kids around the world.
Static Rewards – Success Kid (SKIDDO) seeks to build upon the concept of static 
rewards. Static rewards solve a host of problems. First, the reward amount is 
conditional upon the volume of the token been traded. Static rewards aim to 
minimize the downward sell pressure on the token caused by earlier buyers offloading their tokens after farming sky high APY’s. Second, the reflect feature 
rewards holders to hold their tokens to be rewarded with more tokens which are 
based upon a % carried out and dependent upon the total number of tokens the 
owner holds. Hypothetically, with the manual burn feature and a controlled 
declining supply, even a small holder at the beginning could walk away with big 
money at the end of the token’s lifespan. For every transaction this translates to a 
certain % of the transaction fees earmarked in a charity reserve wallet to be 
distributed to underprivileged kids around the world via organizations voted by the 
community.4
Manual Burn – We recognized the importance of burns in relation to both the 
intrinsic and extrinsic value of a token. Success Kid (SKIDDO) takes a pragmatic 
approach to burns, with the long-term interest of both holders and charitable 
beneficiaries in mind. A continuous burn on any one protocol can be great from the 
starting days, having said that, this implies the burn cannot be controlled in any 
way. Burns of (SKIDDO) are controlled by the team and the voting of community. 
This is to keep the both the community and charitable beneficiaries rewarded and 
informed. The conditions and amounts of the manual burns will be published and 
tracked on Success Kid (SKIDDO) official website, telegram, twitter and discord 
channels.
Automatic Liquidity Provision – Automatic Liquidity Provision underlies the 
mechanics of Success Kid (SKIDDO). This function acts as a two-prong beneficial 
implementation for both holders and charitable beneficiaries. First the smart 
contract assimilates tokens from both buyers and sellers by adding them to the 
Liquidity Pool therefore creating a strong base price. Second the tax in place acts 
as a natural arbitrage mechanism that secures the volume of (SKIDDO) as a reward 
for both holders and charitable beneficiaries. Hypothetically, the additional 
Liquidity Pool creates a stability from the supplied Liquidity Provision by adding the 
tax to the overall liquidity of (SKIDDO), thus increasing the tokens overall Liquidity 
Provision and further provides support to the base price of the token. Over time as 
the (SKIDDO) token Liquidity Provision increases, the price stability mirrors this 
function with the benefits of a strong base price providing a cushioning effect for 
holders. This will prevent large fluctuations especially dips when the whales decides 
to sell their tokens in the later stage. With this methodology Success Kid (SKIDDO) 
will alleviate the current toxicities that are present with the current Defi reflection 
tokens. Our team sees our model and protocol as the new benchmark over the 
outdated reflection tokens.
Charity Reserve Wallet – As the smart contact and protocol works by applying 10% 
fee for each transaction and instantly splitting that fee by rewarding holders with 
5%, auto locking 5% in Pancake LP and 10% of total supply in charity reserve wallet. 
The 5% reward based on the 10% of total supply will be allotted to the charity 
reserve wallet throughout the token’s lifespan will be distributed to charitable 
organizations where the beneficiaries are specifically underprivileged kids around 
the world. The Success Kid (SKIDDO) community will collectively vote and decide 5
on a monthly basis how and which charitable organizations the charity reserve 
wallet will be distributed to. Upon launch, a team of 4 members from the 
community will be invited to overlook the mechanics, discussions on charity drives 
and suggestions on how to better improve and strengthen the process. All charity 
related discussions and transactions will be published in a transparent fashion over 
the Success Kid (SKIDDO) official website, telegram, twitter and discord channels.
